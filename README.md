# Model the learning

Documenting my thoughts, discoveries, and experiments as I'm learning more about R.

Each markdown file catalogs my thoughts as I try to accomplish something new in R.

The data folder contains files with all the data I used along the way.  The scripts folder contains code for the finished product from each session.

- L1: Examining map data in R, creating a basic map
- L2: Adding another aesthetic layer to a map
- L3: Creating a very basic shiny app
- L4: Creating a map from KML data

### Coming soon...

- L5: Get a background map underneath KML/coord data on a map
- L6: Layer map with layer a map with 'real-life' data: population, election data, something like that...
- L7? Another shiny app with a few more moving pieces.  Two or three inputs?  Graph and text output?
- L8? Combine L4 & L5: shiny apps representing 'real-life' data.
- L9? gganimate...  I'm coming for it!  :-)
